- Target Intensity: ${intensity}/10

CONTEXT INFORMATION:
${prContext}

${workoutContext}

${reportContext}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a safe, balanced, and effective workout in strict JSON format matching this exact structure:

{
  "title": "Creative workout name that reflects the category and intensity",
  "notes": "Brief workout description and any important safety considerations",
  "sets": [
    {
      "description": "Clear exercise description with form cues",
      "target": {
        "reps": number (if applicable),
        "weightKg": number (if applicable),
        "distanceM": number (if applicable), 
        "timeSec": number (if applicable)
      }
    }
  ]
}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Respect category constraints and focus on movement patterns appropriate for each category
- Scale difficulty by intensity level 1-10 (1=very easy, 10=extremely challenging)
- Respect duration target within ±10% (${Math.round(duration * 0.9)}-${Math.round(duration * 1.1)} minutes)
- Prefer varied movement patterns compared to recent workouts to prevent overuse
- If risky combinations detected (e.g., heavy spinal loading after max deadlifts), adjust to safer alternatives
- Consider wellness metrics: low energy/sleep = easier workout, high soreness = avoid affected muscle groups
- Use metric units (kg for weight, meters for distance, seconds for time) for non-CrossFit categories
- Provide realistic weights and targets based on recent PR context

Return ONLY the JSON object. No markdown formatting, explanations, or additional text.`;

CROSSFIT WODIFY-STYLE STRUCTURE:
You MUST create a workout with this EXACT 3-section structure:

SECTION 1 - WARM-UP (no creative title):
- Title: "Warm-Up Flow" or "General Prep"
- Duration: 5-8 min
- MUST include 5-7 exercises: Cardio ramp + dynamic stretching + movement-specific priming
- Format: Start with cardio (200-400m), then dynamic movements that prepare for main workout
- Example: 300m Row, 10 Arm Circle, 10 Leg Swing each, 5 Inchworm, 5 Cat-Cow, 10 Air Squat, 5 Push-Up
- Coaching cues: Movement-specific notes about preparing joints and priming patterns for main work (e.g., "Gradually elevate heart rate and mobilize shoulders/hips for overhead work. Focus on opening hip flexors and warming shoulder rotation for the main WOD. Scale: Reduce rounds or substitute easier variations.")

SECTION 2 - MAIN WOD (MUST have creative title):
- Creative Title: Generate a fun, memorable name in ALL CAPS with quotes (examples: "FRUIT LOOPS IN MY ORANGE JUICE", "THE THREE WISE WITCHES", "HOT DOG TREASURE CHEST")
- Score Type: MUST be one of these formats:
  * "For Time" (with time cap like "13:00 time cap!")
  * "AMRAP" (e.g., "15:00 AMRAP", "4:00 AMRAP")
  * "EMOM" (e.g., "28:00 EMOM", "Every 2:00 x 6 Sets")
  * "Intervals" (e.g., "Every 5:00 for 4 rounds", "2:00 on 1:00 off for 5 rounds")
- Duration: 10-20 min (majority of workout time)
- CRITICAL: Main WOD should include 3-5 exercises (varies by format):
  * For Time chipper: 3-5 movements
  * AMRAP: 3-4 movements per round
  * EMOM: 1-3 movements per minute
- **MANDATORY**: ALL cardio MUST include distance/calories (e.g., "500m Row", "15 Cal Bike"), ALL weighted movements MUST include M/F weight (e.g., "@ 95/65lb", "@ 24/16kg")
- Coaching cues: Movement-specific physiological targets and technique focus based on exercises selected (e.g., "Focus on explosive hip drive in thrusters while maintaining upright torso and full lockout overhead. Target 70-80% max heart rate with smooth transitions between movements. Prioritize unbroken sets of wall balls in early rounds. Scale: Reduce barbell to 65/45lb, substitute ring rows for pull-ups, or break movements into smaller sets.")
- **INTERVAL FORMAT RULE**: If using "Intervals" score type, MUST specify complete work/rest structure (e.g., "Work 5:00 / Rest 2:00 x 5 rounds" or "3:00 on / 1:00 off for 6 rounds")
- Format examples:
  * For Time: "21-15-9\\nThrusters @ 95/65lb\\nPull-ups"
  * AMRAP 15: "19 Cal Row\\n19 Wall Ball @ 20/14lb\\n15 Push-ups"
  * EMOM: "minute 1: 3 Wall Walks\\nminute 2: 200m Run\\nminute 3: 15/12 Cal Row"
  * Intervals: "Work 5:00 / Rest 2:00 x 5 rounds\\n500m Row\\n15 Cal Bike\\n400m Run\\n10 Burpee"

SECTION 3 - COOL-DOWN (no creative title):
- Title: "Cool Down" or "Recovery"
- Duration: 3-5 min
- MUST include 3-5 exercises: Static stretches targeting worked muscles + breathing + light movement
- Example: Child's Pose 1 min, Pigeon Stretch 1 min each, Quad Stretch 1 min each, Cat-Cow 10 reps, Deep Breathing 1 min
- Coaching cues: Specific recovery targets based on workout (e.g., "Focus on hip flexor and shoulder mobility after overhead work. Hold static stretches for 60-90 seconds to improve flexibility. Use deep nasal breathing to activate parasympathetic recovery. Scale: Adjust stretch depth based on comfort, avoid pushing into pain.")

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Main section MUST have creative title in quotes and capitals
- **MANDATORY**: ALL cardio MUST include distance in meters or calories (e.g., "500m Row", "15 Cal Bike", "800m Run")
- **MANDATORY**: ALL weighted movements MUST include M/F weight (e.g., "@ 95/65lb", "@ 24/16kg", "@ 20/14lb")
- Include time notation (12:35, 15:00, etc.) where relevant  
- Use @ symbol for weights (e.g., @ 95/65#, @ 50/35#)
- Specify "For Time", "AMRAP", "EMOM", or interval format clearly
- Keep coaching cues SHORT (1-2 sentences max)
- Embed scaling suggestions in coaching cues, not separate section`,

OLYMPIC LIFTING WODIFY-STYLE STRUCTURE:
You MUST create a workout with this EXACT 3-section structure:

SECTION 1 - WARM-UP (no creative title):
- Title: "Warm-Up" or "Movement Prep"
- Duration: 8-10 min
- MUST include 5-7 exercises: Joint mobility + light cardio + PVC work + empty bar technique
- Example: 500m Easy Row, PVC Pass Through 10 reps, Wrist Circles 20, Empty Bar Snatch Balance 8 reps, Overhead Squat 5 reps, Hang Muscle Snatch 5 reps, Front Squat 5 reps
- Coaching cues: Position-specific prep (e.g., "Mobilize wrists, shoulders, and ankles for deep receiving positions. Practice overhead stability with PVC pass-throughs and snatch balance. Rehearse pulling mechanics with empty bar to establish proper timing and positions. Scale: Use PVC pipe for all movements if shoulder mobility limited, add extra wrist prep if needed.")

SECTION 2 - MAIN LIFTS (MUST have creative title):
- Creative Title: Generate a fun, powerful name in ALL CAPS with quotes (examples: "IRON SUMMIT", "THE BARBELL SYMPHONY", "OLYMPIC DOMINATION")
- Score Type: "Score Weight" or "Heavy Single" or "Work Sets"
- Duration: 25-30 min (majority of workout time)
- CRITICAL: MUST include 5-7 exercises total with percentage-based programming:
  1. Primary Olympic lift (REQUIRED - e.g., "Power Snatch 4x1 @ 85% of 1RM" or "Snatch 5x1 @ 80%")
  2. Secondary Olympic lift or variation (REQUIRED - e.g., "Clean & Jerk 3x2 @ 80% of 3RM" or "Hang Clean 4x2 @ 75%")
  3. Squat variation (REQUIRED - e.g., "Back Squat 5RM @ RPE 8" or "Front Squat 4x3 @ 85%")
  4. Pulling movement (REQUIRED - e.g., "Clean Pull 3x3 @ 90%" or "Snatch Pull 4x2 @ 95%")
  5. Accessory movement 1 (REQUIRED - e.g., "BTN Jerk 3x2 @ 70% of 3RM" or "Overhead Squat 3x3")
  6. Accessory movement 2 (REQUIRED - e.g., "Rear Foot Elevated Split Squat 4x6 each" or "Bulgarian Split Squat 3x8 each")
  7. Optional core/stability work (e.g., "Hollow Hold 3x30 sec" or "Plank 3x45 sec")
- Format example with multiple exercises:
  * "Power Snatch 4x1 @ 85% of 1RM"
  * "Clean & Jerk 3x2 @ 80%"
  * "Back Squat 4x3 @ 85%"
  * "Snatch Pull 3x3 @ 95%"
  * "BTN Jerk 3x2 @ 70%"
  * "Walking Lunge 3x10 each"
  * "Hollow Hold 3x30 sec"
- Coaching cues: Technique-specific targets for Olympic lifts (e.g., "Focus on aggressive turnover in snatches with active pull under the bar. Maintain vertical torso in front squat receiving position. Emphasize speed through the power position on cleans with quick elbow rotation. Target bar speed over load on technique sets. Scale: Reduce percentages by 10-15% to prioritize positions and speed, use hang variations to practice timing, or substitute power variations for full lifts if mobility limited.")

SECTION 3 - COOL-DOWN (no creative title):
- Title: "Cool Down" or "Recovery"
- Duration: 3-5 min
- MUST include 3-5 exercises: Hip/shoulder-focused stretching + mobility + breathing
- Example: Couch Stretch 2 min each, Thoracic Rotations 10 each, Lat Stretch 1 min each, Child's Pose 1 min, Deep Breathing 2 min
- Coaching cues: Recovery for Olympic lifting demands (e.g., "Prioritize hip flexor and ankle mobility after deep squat receiving positions. Open thoracic spine and lats after overhead work. Hold stretches 90+ seconds for tissue adaptation. Use box breathing (4-4-4-4) to downregulate nervous system after heavy lifting. Scale: Add foam rolling for tight areas, extend stretch duration if needed.")

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Main section MUST have creative title in quotes and capitals
- Main section MUST have 5-7 exercises minimum (mirror screenshot example!)
- Use percentage-based programming (e.g., "@ 85% of 1RM", "@ RPE 8", "5RM")
- Include Olympic lifts (Snatch, Clean, Jerk variations) + Squats + Accessories
- Score type is typically "Score Weight" for maximal efforts
- Keep coaching cues SHORT (1-2 sentences max)
- Embed scaling suggestions in coaching cues`,
