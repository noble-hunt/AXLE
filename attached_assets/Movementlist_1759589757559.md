## Implementation Notes

### Exercise Modifiers & Variations
Most exercises can be modified by:
- **Equipment:** Barbell, Dumbbell, Kettlebell, Cable, Machine, Bands, Bodyweight
- **Tempo:** Standard, Slow Eccentric (3-5 seconds), Pause at Bottom, Explosive Concentric
- **Range:** Full ROM, Partial Reps, Deficit (Elevated), Elevated
- **Stance:** Wide, Narrow, Neutral, Staggered, Single-Leg
- **Grip:** Overhand (Pronated), Underhand (Supinated), Neutral, Wide, Close, Mixed
- **Angle:** Flat, Incline (15°, 30°, 45°, 60°), Decline
- **Unilateral:** Single-Arm, Single-Leg, Alternating vs Simultaneous

### Progressive Difficulty
Movements within each category progress from beginner to advanced:
- **Beginner:** Wall push-ups, box squats, banded pull-ups, incline variations
- **Intermediate:** Standard variations with good form and full range of motion
- **Advanced:** Weighted variations, deficit work, single-limb variations, complex movements

### Database Organization Recommendations
For a workout generation app, consider organizing exercises by:
1. **Category/Discipline** (Olympic Weightlifting, Powerlifting, Bodybuilding, etc.)
2. **Primary Muscle Group** (Quads, Hamstrings, Chest, Back, Shoulders, Arms, Core)
3. **Movement Pattern** (Squat, Hinge, Push, Pull, Carry, Lunge, Rotation)
4. **Equipment Required** (Barbell, Dumbbell, Kettlebell, Cable, Machine, Bodyweight, Bands)
5. **Difficulty Level** (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Elite)
6. **Exercise Type** (Compound, Isolation, Plyometric, Static Hold, Dynamic Stretch)

### Programming Considerations
- **Olympic Weightlifting:** Technical complexity requires proper progressions; perform when fresh
- **Powerlifting:** Focus on main lifts with variations for weak points; periodize intensity
- **Bodybuilding:** Higher volume with mix of compound and isolation; train to near failure
- **Gymnastics:** Emphasize strict movements before kipping; build strength through holds
- **CrossFit:** Constantly varied; combine all three modalities (M-G-W) in workouts
- **Cardio:** Mix steady-state and intervals; vary modalities to prevent overuse
- **Mobility:** Daily practice; use dynamic for warm-up, static for cool-down
