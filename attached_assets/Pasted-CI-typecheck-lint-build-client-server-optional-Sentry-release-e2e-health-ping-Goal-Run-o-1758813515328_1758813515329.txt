CI: typecheck, lint, build (client & server) + optional Sentry release + e2e health ping

Goal
Run on PR and main: install deps, typecheck & lint for server and client, build client, (optionally) upload source maps to Sentry, then ping /api/healthz in prod.

Secrets to add (in GitHub → Repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret):

PROD_SITE_URL — e.g. https://your-vercel-url.vercel.app

(optional, only if you want Sentry release in CI)
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN, SENTRY_ORG, SENTRY_PROJECT_WEB

Acceptance

PRs & pushes show ✅ for typecheck/lint/build.

Artifact client-dist is present on successful runs.

e2e-ping fails loudly if GET $PROD_SITE_URL/api/healthz fails.

(If Sentry secrets added) A Sentry release is created for main; web source maps are uploaded.

Note: this assumes your /api/healthz exists and returns 200. (We added that earlier; if not, the agent should create a minimal route.)
