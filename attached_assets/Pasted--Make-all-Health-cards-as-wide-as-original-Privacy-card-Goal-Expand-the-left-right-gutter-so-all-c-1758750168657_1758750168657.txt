“Make all Health cards as wide as original Privacy card”

Goal
Expand the left/right gutter so all cards above Privacy line up to the same width as the original Privacy card. Do not reduce Privacy width; instead increase everything else. Prevent any double-padding that narrows cards.

1) Replace the Section wrapper with a wider gutter (mobile-first)

Update client/src/components/layout/Section.tsx to use a wider mobile gutter and scale slightly up on larger breakpoints. (The earlier px-6 made things narrower.)

// client/src/components/layout/Section.tsx
import React from "react";

/**
 * Page gutter for the Health screen.
 * Use a slightly smaller padding to make content WIDER.
 * This matches the original Privacy card visual width.
 *
 * Mobile:  px-4  (16px per side)
 * >=sm:    px-5  (20px per side)
 * >=md:    px-6  (24px per side) – optional headroom on tablets
 */
export default function Section({
  children,
  className,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{ className?: string }>) {
  return <div className={`w-full px-4 sm:px-5 md:px-6 ${className ?? ""}`}>{children}</div>;
}


If Privacy still looks wider on your device, drop mobile to px-3 (12px) and keep sm:px-5 md:px-6. But px-4 usually matches the original Privacy look on typical mobile widths.

2) Ensure everything on the Health page uses Section exactly once

Edit client/src/pages/health.tsx (or your Health page) so each block is wrapped by Section once and not nested in extra containers that add horizontal padding:

import Section from "@/components/layout/Section";
import { PageTitle, SectionTitle } from "@/components/typography/Heading";
import ProviderCard from "@/components/health/ProviderCard";

/* A) Title + Stat tiles */
<Section>
  <PageTitle>Connect Health Providers</PageTitle>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 py-6 shadow">{/* Connected */}</div>
    <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 py-6 shadow">{/* Available */}</div>
  </div>
</Section>

/* B) Development Mode row (center the label vertically) */
<Section className="mt-4">
  <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] h-14 px-5 flex items-center justify-between shadow">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span className="i-lucide-settings h-5 w-5 opacity-80" />
      <span className="text-base font-medium text-white">Development Mode</span>
    </div>
    <DevModeSwitch />
  </div>
</Section>

/* C) Providers header + list (full width) */
<Section className="mt-6">
  <SectionTitle>Health Providers</SectionTitle>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
    {/* ProviderCard elements */}
  </div>
</Section>

/* D) Privacy card – IMPORTANT: also inside a SINGLE <Section>, no extra horizontal wrappers */
<Section className="mt-6">
  {/* Privacy Settings card as-is */}
</Section>


Important sanity check:
Search the file for other wrappers like container, mx-4, px-6, etc., around these blocks. Remove any extra horizontal padding on parents. The only horizontal padding should come from Section.

3) ProviderCard must be full-width within Section (no extra margins)

Verify client/src/components/health/ProviderCard.tsx outer container:

<div className="w-full rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] shadow px-5 py-4">
  {/* ... */}
</div>


No mx-* or extra px-* on parent containers other than the card’s internal px-5 (that’s inner padding, not page gutter).

Keep actions stacked and compact:

{/* Right action column */}
<div className="flex flex-col items-stretch gap-2 shrink-0 w-36">
  <button className="h-9 rounded-xl text-sm font-medium ...">Sync Now</button>
  <button className="h-9 rounded-xl text-sm font-medium ...">Disconnect</button>
</div>

4) Headings parity

Ensure:

<PageTitle>Connect Health Providers</PageTitle>
<SectionTitle>Health Providers</SectionTitle>


Both components should render at text-3xl font-bold per your Heading.tsx. If not, align the styles there.

5) Remove any double-wrapping of the Privacy card

If the Privacy card sits inside another layout component (e.g., a page-level container with padding), remove that extra padding or convert it to a simple div without px-*. The Privacy card should only receive width from the same Section as everything else.

Acceptance Criteria

On mobile, all cards (Connected, Available, Dev Mode row, every Provider card, Privacy Settings) share identical left/right edges and are as wide as the original Privacy card (i.e., wider than before).

There is no double horizontal padding anywhere; no card is narrower than others.

Provider action buttons are stacked vertically, compact, and fully inside the card with comfortable spacing (no overlap or clipping).

The “Development Mode” label is vertically centered with its switch.

“Connect Health Providers” and “Health Providers” headings use the same font size/weight and align visually.

No horizontal scrolling on iOS Safari/Chrome Android; text does not clip at the edges.

If it’s still a hair narrower than your original Privacy look, lower the mobile gutter once more (change px-4 → px-3 in Section.tsx) and re-run. The point is: we widen the content by reducing the gutter, not by shrinking Privacy.
