“Unify Health page gutters; match Privacy card width”

Goal
Make the Connected / Available tiles and all provider cards use the exact same horizontal padding (gutter) as the Privacy Settings card so their left/right edges line up perfectly. Keep the provider actions stacked as before.

1) Create a single page gutter wrapper and use it everywhere

Add client/src/components/layout/Section.tsx (or update if it already exists):

import React from "react";

/**
 * Mobile-first page gutter that matches Privacy card width.
 * Use this wrapper for EVERY block on the Health page.
 * px-6 = 24px per side on mobile. Adjust here if you ever change the design.
 */
export default function Section({
  children,
  className,
}: React.PropsWithChildren<{ className?: string }>) {
  return <div className={`w-full px-6 ${className ?? ""}`}>{children}</div>;
}


We’re standardizing on px-6 because the Privacy card is already using that effective width. If the Privacy card is using a different outer wrapper, match that value here.

2) Wrap all Health page blocks with Section

In client/src/pages/health.tsx (or your Health page file), ensure these blocks are wrapped:

import Section from "@/components/layout/Section";
import { PageTitle, SectionTitle } from "@/components/typography/Heading";
import ProviderCard from "@/components/health/ProviderCard";

// 1) Title + Stat tiles
<Section>
  <PageTitle>Connect Health Providers</PageTitle>
  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
    <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 py-6 shadow">{/* Connected */}</div>
    <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 py-6 shadow">{/* Available */}</div>
  </div>
</Section>

// 2) Development Mode row (vertically centered)
<Section className="mt-4">
  <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 h-14 flex items-center justify-between shadow">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
      <span className="i-lucide-settings h-5 w-5 opacity-80" />
      <span className="text-base font-medium text-white">Development Mode</span>
    </div>
    <DevModeSwitch />
  </div>
</Section>

// 3) Health Providers list (vertical stack, full width)
<Section className="mt-6">
  <SectionTitle>Health Providers</SectionTitle>
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
    {/* one ProviderCard per provider */}
    <ProviderCard .../>
    <ProviderCard .../>
    {/* etc */}
  </div>
</Section>

// 4) (Leave Privacy Settings as-is, but ALSO ensure it's inside <Section> too)
<Section className="mt-6">
  {/* Privacy Settings card */}
</Section>


The important bit: Everything above Privacy must also be inside <Section> now. That guarantees all cards share the same gutter and align to Privacy card edges.

3) Keep provider cards full-width inside the Section

Your ProviderCard outer container should already be:

<div className="w-full rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] shadow px-5 py-4">
  {/* content… */}
</div>


Do not add extra horizontal margins on the card itself (no mx-4, etc.). The Section provides the only left/right gutter we want.

4) Stat tiles must not add extra outer padding

Inside the tiles block, ensure the tiles themselves don’t introduce extra outer spacing beyond px-5 internal padding:

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 py-6 shadow">{/* tile */}</div>
  <div className="rounded-2xl bg-[#1d1f24] px-5 py-6 shadow">{/* tile */}</div>
</div>


No additional mx-* on the tiles or grid container—the Section wrapper controls the width.

5) Button stack sizing (keep compact)

Confirm provider card action column:

<div className="flex flex-col items-stretch gap-2 shrink-0 w-36">
  {/* h-9 = 36px tall, text-sm, rounded-xl per earlier prompt */}
</div>


That prevents overflow and keeps actions neatly stacked.

6) Verify headings parity

Both titles use the same component and size:

<PageTitle>Connect Health Providers</PageTitle>
<SectionTitle>Health Providers</SectionTitle>


In Heading.tsx, both are text-3xl font-bold as set earlier.

Acceptance Criteria

Every card above Privacy (stat tiles, Dev Mode row, each Provider card) aligns perfectly with the left and right edges of the Privacy card on mobile.

No card is narrower or wider; no extra horizontal margins exist outside the unified Section gutter (px-6).

Provider actions (Sync Now, Disconnect, Connect) remain stacked vertically at a fixed width, with no overlap.

Headings “Connect Health Providers” and “Health Providers” are the same size and weight.

Development Mode row label is visually centered with the switch.

No horizontal scrolling; text never clips on iOS Safari or Chrome Android.

If the Privacy card still looks wider after this, it means that specific card is not inside <Section> or has its own extra horizontal margins—wrap it with <Section> and remove any outer mx-*.
